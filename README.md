## OpenAI Whisper
> OpenAI AI Transcribe API expects file objects. Hence, to make it work with remote files, we need to download the file first and then pass it to the API. References [community discussion](https://community.openai.com/t/whisper-can-we-transcribe-from-url-and-file-upload/95700) and [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createTranscription).

**Points to Note**
* AWS Transcribe processes audio files asynchronously. We start a transcription job and then periodically check for its completion. This is why there's a `time.sleep(0.5)` in the script. The sleep duration is a balance between checking too frequently and waiting too long.
* AWS Transcribe requires the audio file to be accessible from an S3 bucket.
* AWS Transcribe stores the transcription results in a JSON file in the same S3 bucket. We need to download this file and parse it to get the transcription text.
